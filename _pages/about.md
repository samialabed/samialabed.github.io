I am a Senior Research Scientist at **Google DeepMind**, Technical Infrastructure Research group, where I specialize in the hardware-software co-design of Machine Learning systems and Silicon Architecture.

Currently, my research interest is in accelerating TPU tape-out cycles and architect novel hardware units. My expertise spans the full stack—from AI model design and performance optimization to compiler stacks and hardware synthesis. Previously, I led the integration of MCTS-driven search within production compiler stacks (XLA). My work on automatic partitioning for massive-scale models consistently outperformed expert-hand-tuned configurations, directly enhancing the efficiency of large-model training.

Beyond the lab, I am the co-founder and co-director of [MenaML](https://mena.ml), a machine learning school focused on building the AI talent pipeline in the MENA region, with sucessful track record and high calibare candidates. MenaML itself is a technical non-profit organization of 30+ staff from top AI labs driven by the mission of improving science and education access in the region.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the **University of Cambridge**, [Systems Research Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/), where I was supervised by [Dr Eiko Yoneki](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ey204/). My doctoral thesis focused on optimizing complex systems by leveraging causal latent structures, culminating in a custom-built, high-efficiency Structured Bayesian Optimization engine designed for large-scale graphs with a minimal memory footprint. I was also a Doctoral Student at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), the national AI and data science institute in the UK.

I earned my *MPhil Advanced Computer Science* with Distinction from the **University of Cambridge**, supported by the [Cambridge Trust](https://www.cambridgetrust.org/) and the Students of Cambridge awards. I hold a *BSc Computer Science with Industrial Experience* from **The University of Manchester** , where I received multiple awards for my contributions to student employability and departmental life, co-founded Manchester's HackSoc, and [GreatUnihack](https://www.greatunihack.com) one of the longest running hackathons in the UK focused on collaboration and healthy creative competition.

My professional background includes engineering roles at  **Amazon**, **Google**, **Twitter**, and **DeepMind** , focusing on large-scale distributed systems.
