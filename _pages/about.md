I am currently a second-year PhD student in the [Systems Research Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/) of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory being supervised by [Dr Eiko Yoneki](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ey204/). I am also a Doctoral Student at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). I am working on the intersection of Machine Learning and Computer systems. My thesis is on designing computer systems using Bayesian Network as building blocks optimized with Bayesian Optimization.

I obtained a distinction in the MPhil Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge in 2019 while I was awarded the Cambridge Trust and Students of Cambridge awards to fund my MPhil. Before then, I graduated with a first from The University of Manchester in a BSc Computer Science with Industrial Experience. I have received multiple awards in Manchester to improve the students' life and employability prospects at the department. 

I enjoy hackathons and tinkering with quick prototypes on weekends, with various projects hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/samialabed?tab=repositories). Previously I worked as a backend software engineer at Amazon, Google, and Twitter, working on large scale systems.
