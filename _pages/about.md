I am currently a second-year PhD student in the [Systems Research Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/) of the **University of Cambridge** Computer Laboratory being supervised by [Dr Eiko Yoneki](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ey204/). I am also a Doctoral Student at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). My main research interest is the intersection of *Machine Learning and Computer systems design*. My thesis is on designing computer systems with *Bayesian Networks* as building blocks, enabling fast and robust auto-tuning with *Bayesian Optimization* and auto-recovery with *counterfactual inference*.

I obtained a distinction in the *MPhil Advanced Computer Science* at the **University of Cambridge** in 2019. I was awarded the [Cambridge Trust](https://www.cambridgetrust.org/) and the Students of Cambridge awards to fund my MPhil. Before then, I graduated with a first from The **University of Manchester** in a *BSc Computer Science with Industrial Experience*. I have received multiple awards in Manchester for improving the students' life and employability prospects at the department.

Previously I worked at **Amazon**, **Google**, and **Twitter** on large scale distributed systems. I have been to many hackathons where I try quick ideas or implement interesting papers, you can see some of the projects hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/samialabed?tab=repositories).
