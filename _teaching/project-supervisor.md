Yearly supervision of masters students at University of Cambridge on topics of computer system optimizaiton using Bayesian optimization and Reinforcement learning. 
Responsibilities:

* Regular meeting to provide a high-level supervision to master-level projects.
* Provide initial ideas in collaboration with my supervisor, Dr Eiko Yoneki, on her [website](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ey204/teaching/Projects/2020_2021/).
